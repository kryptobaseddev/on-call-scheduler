### 3. Detailed Requirements
#### 3.1 User Roles and Permissions
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with three levels:

**Admin**
- Full access to all features and settings.
- Can create, edit, and delete users, managers, and teams.
- Manage system-wide settings and configurations.

**Manager**
- Manages team members within their team.
- Approve or deny time-off requests.
- Adjust on-call schedules for their team.
- Assign applications and services to team members.
- View and edit team notes and announcements.

**User**
- View joint on-call schedules.
- Access personalized dashboard with their schedules.
- Submit time-off requests.
- Search for other users and view their on-call assignments.
- View team and company-wide notes and announcements.

**Authentication Flow:**
- Users are created by Admins or Managers; no public sign-up.
- Secure login with encrypted passwords (bcrypt).
- Session management using JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- Password reset functionality managed by Admins/Managers.

#### 3.2 Data Models
Design the database with normalized tables and relationships to accommodate expanded user information and functionality.

**User Model**
- Fields: id, firstName, lastName, email, passwordHash, workPhone, mobilePhone, profilePicture, bio, expertise, role, teamId, teamRoles, createdAt, updatedAt

**Team Model**
- Fields: id, name, colorCode, applicationsServices, managerId, contactInfo, createdAt, updatedAt

**Application/Service Model**
- Fields: id, name, description, teamId, leadUserId, createdAt, updatedAt

**Schedule Model**
- Fields: id, userId, teamId, startTime, endTime, isRepeating, repeatInterval, notes, createdAt, updatedAt

**TimeOffRequest Model**
- Fields: id, userId, teamId, startTime, endTime, status, reason, managerComment, createdAt, updatedAt

**Holiday Model**
- Fields: id, name, date, isObserved, createdAt, updatedAt

**Notes Model**
- Fields: id, content, startDate, endDate, visibility, teamId, userId, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt

**Relationships:**
- Users belong to Teams.
- Teams have many Users.
- Applications/Services are associated with Teams and Users.
- Schedules are linked to Users and Teams.
- TimeOffRequests are linked to Users and Teams.
- Notes can be global, team-specific, or user-specific.

### 4. User Interface Design
#### General Design Principles
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application works seamlessly across devices.
- **Consistent Styling:** Use Material-UI theming for a cohesive look.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines for accessible content.

#### Login Page
- Simple login form with email and password fields.
- Option to contact Admin/Manager if login details are forgotten.

#### Main Dashboard (After Login)
**For All Users:**
- **Current On-Call Week View:** Calendar or timeline displaying the current week. Teams are color-coded for easy differentiation. Ability to hover over shifts to see details.
- **Notes and Announcements:** Display global and team-specific notes.

**Personal Dashboard (User-Specific):**
- **My Schedule:** List or calendar view of upcoming on-call shifts. Status of time-off requests.
- **Time-Off Requests:** Form to submit new requests.

**Manager Dashboard:**
- **Team Management:** View and edit team members' profiles.
- **Schedule Management:** Drag-and-drop interface for assigning shifts.

### 5. Backend Functionality
#### Authentication and Authorization
- Secure endpoints using JWT tokens.
- Middleware to enforce role-based access control.

#### API Endpoints
**Authentication:**
- POST /api/login, POST /api/logout

**User Management:**
- GET /api/users, POST /api/users, PUT /api/users/:id, DELETE /api/users/:id

**Team Management:**
- GET /api/teams, POST /api/teams, PUT /api/teams/:id, DELETE /api/teams/:id

**Application/Service Management:**
- GET /api/applications, POST /api/applications, PUT /api/applications/:id, DELETE /api/applications/:id

**Schedule Management:**
- GET /api/schedules, POST /api/schedules, PUT /api/schedules/:id, DELETE /api/schedules/:id

**Time-Off Requests:**
- GET /api/timeoff, POST /api/timeoff, PUT /api/timeoff/:id, DELETE /api/timeoff/:id

**Notes Management:**
- GET /api/notes, POST /api/notes, PUT /api/notes/:id, DELETE /api/notes/:id

**Holiday Management:**
- GET /api/holidays, POST /api/holidays, PUT /api/holidays/:id, DELETE /api/holidays/:id

### 6. Database Design
**Schema Details**
- Users, Teams, Applications/Services, Expertise Junction Table, Schedules, TimeOffRequests, Notes, Holidays

### 7. Security Considerations
- **Password Security:** Use bcrypt for hashing passwords.

- **Implementation:** Use a service like SendGrid or AWS SES.

**In-App Notifications**
- **Features:** Notification center in the dashboard, real-time alerts for critical updates, dismissible notifications.

### 9. Deployment and DevOps
**Version Control and Collaboration**
- Git repository hosted on GitHub.
- Branching strategy like GitFlow.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- Automated testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.

**Environment Management**
- Use .env files for environment variables.

- **Integration Testing:** Validate API endpoints and data flow between front-end and back-end.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Cypress or Selenium for simulating user interactions.
- **Performance Testing:** JMeter or LoadRunner to test application under load.
- **Security Testing:** Vulnerability scans and penetration testing before production release.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve end-users to gather feedback and refine the application.

### 11. Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Scheduling Algorithms:** AI-driven suggestions for optimal rotations.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Dashboards showing key metrics (e.g., coverage gaps, time-off trends).
- **Calendar Integration:** Sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
- **Mobile Application:** Native iOS and Android apps for better accessibility.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Predictive analytics for staffing needs.
